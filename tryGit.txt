Learning more about Git
We only scratched the surface of Git in this course. There is so much more you can do with it. Check out the Git documentation for a full list of functions.
The Pro Git book, by Scott Chacon, is an excellent resource to teach you the inner workings of Git.
help.github and GitHub Training are also great for anything related to Git in general and using Git with GitHub.
